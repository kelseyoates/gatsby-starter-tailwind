place: a recording studio<br />
time: now<br /></p>


<p className="character-list">
Characters:<br />
Ben - plays Tiger, Lion<br />
Faye <br />
Katie <br />
Victoria - plays PB <br />
Jennifer - plays Big Bear </p>

<p className="stage">Ben is recording his dialogue for the new animated film, “Life’s a Zoo”. He plays multiple animals.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> And then I said, I am Tiger, hear me roar!</p>
<p className="character">Lion</p>
<p> Oh please, Tiger, there is no way that you did that.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> I know you don’t believe me, Mr. Lion, but believe it. I roared, and I was heard.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

 <p> Cut!</p>
<p className="character">Ben</p>

 <p> What? That was good.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

 <p> Yeah it was, but I’ve got another couple of actors who have to come in.</p>
<p className="character">Ben</p>

 <p> What? We don’t ever record people together.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

 <p> Well, that’s the news from above.</p>
 <p className="stage">Victoria and Jennifer walk in.</p>
<p className="character">Ben</p>

 <p> Oh no. Not these two.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>

 <p> Yes, Ben. It’s us. Only one of the most successful double-acts in comedy.</p>
<p className="character">Jennifer</p>

 <p> Just because you’ve lost the Grammy, Oscar, Emmy, and Tony to us, doesn’t mean you should be mad. It means you should be wicked mad.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

 <p> Guys, if we could all please just get along. This is a huge production and I’d like it to go as smoothly as possible.</p>
 <p className="stage">Katie walks in.</p>
<p className="character">Katie</p>

 <p> Listen up, y’all. I am the director of this film and I am the one who decided that you should all be here, together. I wanted to try something different, so stop complaining and get to work.</p>
<p className="character">Jennifer</p>

 <p> I have no problem with it.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>

 <p> Me neither.</p>
<p className="character">Ben</p>

 <p> I guess I don’t have a problem, even though these girls are evil.</p>
<p className="character">Katie</p>

 <p> Ben, I’m not paying you a million dollars to talk about them.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

 <p> If you guys could hurry up, we’ve only got so much studio time.</p>
<p className="stage">They get back in position in the booth.</p>
<p className="character">Faye (CONT’D) </p>

 <p> Three, two-</p>
 <p className="stage">Faye motions for them to go.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> Ugh, I’m so hot.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> It’s snowing.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> Well, I’m sorry I’m a polar bear and am used to my wonderful subzero temperatures. Honestly, it’s like a sauna in here.</p>
<p className="character">BIG BEAR</p>
<p>Hey, girl. Look what I just found!</p>
<p className="stage">In the movie, Victoria will be holding up a zookeeper, who is nervously dangling in her paw.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> Big Bear, you can’t do that.</p>
<p className="character">BIG BEAR</p>
<p>What? Look how cute he is! I just wanted to play with him.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> No, we don’t play with the humans.</p>
<p className="character">BIG BEAR</p>
<p>Wait, so they can take us from the Arctic all the way to America, and yet we can’t even have some fun with them? That is ridiculous.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> Isn’t it?</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> This was an A B conversation, so if you could just C your way out, that’d be great.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> Oh, so you’re not interested in hearing a good idea.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> No-</p>
<p className="character">BIG BEAR</p>
<p>Wait wait wait- hear him out. Tigers get good ideas all the time-</p>
<p className="stage">Big Bear and PB burst out laughing.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> Laugh all you want, but I know a way to get out of here.</p>
<p className="stage">Their ears all perk up.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger (CONT’D) </p>
<p> I’ve been studying some science, and I think I have a way to stop the electric fence from hurting us.</p>
<p className="character">BIG BEAR</p>
<p>Psshawww.</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> Hand me the tool belt from that Zookeeper.</p>
<p className="stage">In the film, Big Bear takes the still scared Zookeeper’s toolbelt and gives it to Tiger. Tiger walks up to an electrical box and does stuff. Suddenly, a loud clunk is heard. Tiger touches the fence and there is no more current. Everyone gasps.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> How did you do that?!</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> I told you, I’ve been studying. All right everyone, let’s go.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> Wait, aren’t we going to help all the other animals?</p>
<p className="character">Tiger</p>
<p> I would, but then we’ll be more likely to get caught. I don’t wanna put anyone’s life at risk. These humans, they’ll just start shooting. They brought us here and then they’re happy to just end us whenever they want to. We can come back for the others at a later time. Right now, I just wanna get out there into the jungle.</p>
<p className="character">PB</p>
<p> Let’s go!</p>
<p className="character">BIG BEAR</p>
<p>Let’s go!</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

 <p> Cut!!! Wow, guys, that was great.</p>
<p className="character">Katie</p>

 <p> Yes, brava. That wasn’t so bad, was it.</p>
<p className="character">Ben</p>

 <p> Call me when my DVD money comes in.</p>
<p className="character">Jennifer</p>

 <p> Peace out, y’all.</p>
<p className="stage">Blackout. End of play. </p>
