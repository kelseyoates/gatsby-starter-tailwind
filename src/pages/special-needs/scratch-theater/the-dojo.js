<p className="stage">Hooligans are out and about, dangerously loitering in front of the Dojo.</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 1 </p>

<p> Dude, what are we doing here?</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 2 </p>

<p> Danny said he had something big to do.</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 3 </p>

<p> What is it? How come he didn’t come early?</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 2 </p>

<p> I dunno, maybe he’s getting something ready.</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 1 </p>

<p> Well he’s better get here soon. It’s Thursday afternoon and I got things to do. I’m wasting my time here when I could be watching perfectly good Reba reruns.</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 2 </p>

<p> Aww, can it, Kirby. If Danny says we should be here, then we should be here.</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 3 </p>

<p> Hey, there’s the knucklehead now.</p>
<p className="stage">Danny turns the corner.</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> Sup, boys?</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 3 </p>

<p> Well well well if it isn’t his majesty.</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> What? Why the hostility, Johnny Boy? You gotta keep it cool, boy. Real cool.</p>
<p className="stage">Hooligan 3 is clearly agitated, waiting for Danny’s instructions.</p>
<p className="character">Danny (CONT’D)</p>

<p>  All right all right all right. I hope you all got your black belts, because today, this day, this afternoon...we are taking out my most notorious enemy.</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 2 </p>

<p> Who’s that?</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> The one and only...Miss Faye Remington.</p>
<p className="stage">They all gasp in terror!</p>
<p className="character">Hooligan 2 </p>

<p> But Danny, she’s the fiercest karate kid in all of Norwood! And she’s got oodles of friends who would die defending her.</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> Exactly. All I want to do is cause chaos in this town, and she’s the one stopping me. I get rid of Faye, I get rid of the problem.</p>
<p className="stage">Blackout. Lights up. Faye and her party guests are learning some wicked cool moves.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> This is so much fun! I’m so glad you all came out here to join in on my birthday fun.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>

<p> Hey, Faye. I’m loving this party. I’m learning so many awesome self-defense moves.</p>
<p className="character">Taylor Swift</p>

<p> Yeah, Faye, this has been amazing. And your cake was fabu-fan-tabulous. And you know how rarely I combine words.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> Thanks, guys, and thanks to everyone who came out to my party. It’s been a real blast having everyone together. I know it’s my birthday, but it’s really just a chance for all of us to get together and have fun. That and getting loads of presents.</p>

<p className="character">Faye's Mom</p>

<p>Well now that we’ve had the cake and everyone seems a bit tuckered out, why don’t we pop out and have some tea and scones and crumpets.</p>
<p className="stage">They exit and are immediately confronted by the malicious group known only as the Jackson 4. (They were unable to find a fifth member.)</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> Well, what in the world are you doing here?</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> Oh I’m just hanging out. And taking you out!</p>
<p className="stage">He whips a nunchuck at Faye’s Mom, knocking her to the ground.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> How dare you, good sir!</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> I can do anything I want! I’m Danny, of the Jackson 4! I am here to Take. You. Out.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> Not if I can help it!</p>
<p className="stage">Faye does her karate moves. Quickly, her birthday pals join in, having just learned some good self-defense moves. A fight ensues. There is blood, there is sweat, and there are tears. At last!, though, Faye and her gang are victorious.</p>
<p className="character">Faye (CONT’D)</p>

<p>  I don’t want you coming back here any time soon. Heck, I don’t want you coming back, ever!</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> <span class="parenthetical">(whimpering)</span> You may have won this one, Faye, but I am still very victorious. For it is I, Danny McDanny, who has just killed your mother!</p>

<p className="character">Faye's Mom</p>

<p>Not so fast, buddy boy!</p>
<p className="stage">They all turn and gasp.</p>

<p className="character">Faye's Mom (CONT’D) </p>

<p>For the past few months I have been working undercover, trying to catch those who grow the seeds of destruction in the underbelly of my beloved Norwood.</p>
<p className="stage">She unzips her hoodie to reveal a nunchuk-proof vest.</p>

<p className="character">Faye's Mom (CONT’D) </p>

<p>I’m sorry you had to think that I was dead, Faye, but it was the only thing I could do to protect you.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> It’s cool.</p>
<p className="character">Danny</p>

<p> Fine, I’m outta here. I’ll go terrorize another town. Maybe Walpole, maybe Dedham. But this ain’t the last you’ll see of me. I promise.</p>
<p className="character">Faye</p>

<p> And I promise that we’ll crush you, just as we did right now. Now you get outta here!</p>
<p className="stage">Danny and the Jackson 4 limp/scurry away. Everyone holds up Faye as they chant, “Faye, Faye, Faye, Faye!”  Blackout. End of play.</p>
