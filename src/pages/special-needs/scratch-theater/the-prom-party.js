<p className="stage">The local rec center has been decorated for the prom that celebrates the class of 1986. The kitchen is busy making chicken parm, the DJ is ready to play the day’s hottest hits, and the students are about to arrive. Enter Muffy, Bunny, and Skip.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> Finally, that limo ride took forever.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> But it was a party bus. I was hoping we’d get lost just so we could stay in it.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> Look at all the balloons.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> I helped decorate it.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> Yes yes yes, Miss President of the class. It’s all you’ve been talking about for the last two months.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> Don’t listen to him. You did a good job.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> Thanks, Bunny.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> You’re welcome, Muffy. Hey, Skip, I thought you did the music.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> No, I hired a DJ so I could dance.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> Where is she?</p><p className="stage">“Hey, Mickey you’re so fine, you’re so fine you blow my mind hey, Mickey!” The DJ has started the party.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> That’s what I’m talking about.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> I’m so glad we’re here. We’ve worked so hard during this school year, it’s nice that we can cut loose and have fun.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> Wait - who are those people?</p><p className="stage">Kiki, Barbie, and Trip enter in a commanding manner.</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> What are you people doing at our prom?</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> Your prom? This is our prom.</p><p className="stage">A Teacher stands next to the DJ and announces:</p><p className="character">Teacher</p>
<p> Attention, students. This year, we have decided to combine the proms of Alastair Academy and Louisville Latin in order to save money that can then be spent on other, more important things, like lacrosse and dead languages.</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> No! I don’t like it.</p><p className="character">Trip</p>
<p> Let’s go somewhere else.</p><p className="character">Teacher</p>
<p> For safety purposes, you will not be allowed to leave until the end of the prom. Have fun.</p><p className="stage">The teacher leaves and the DJ resumes the music.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> This is terrible. I don’t want to dance with them.</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> Well, we don’t want to dance with you.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> You’d be so lucky to dance with us. We’re wicked good.</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> Please, you couldn’t possibly be better than us. Louisville Latin is world famous for its musical versions of Homer’s epics.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> Whatever.</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> You’re just scared of us.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> As if.</p><p className="character">Trip</p>
<p> We are the best school.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> If you’re the best school, then prove it.</p><p className="stage">Gasp! The gauntlet has been thrown.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Muffy and Bunny)</span> Muffy, what are you doing? Kiki, Barbie, and Trip are the best dancers at their school. Is this really a fight you want to get into?</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p><span className="parenthetical">(to Skip and Bunny)</span> Yeah, let’s not get cocky.</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Kiki and Trip)</span> How dare they.</p><p className="character">Trip</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Kiki and Barbie)</span> But they are good dancers.</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Trip and Barbie)</span> Come on, guys, don’t get scared now. This is what we’ve been preparing for. <span className="parenthetical">(to Muffy)</span> What exactly are you suggesting?</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> An old-school dance-off. Winner gets to stay and use the dance floor. Loser has to sit at the tables all night long.</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Kiki)</span> Don’t do it!</p><p className="character">Trip</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Kiki)</span> Yeah, what if we lose? I don’t wanna sit all night.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Muffy)</span> This is too dangerous. What if we lose?</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Muffy)</span> Yeah, I just don’t see this working out in our favor.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Bunny and Skip)</span> Come on, you guys. Have a little confidence. This is no different from what we do at school and at the underground dancing competition the Streets. Step up!</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> All right, Miss Muffy. You’re on. A dance-off between Alastair Academy and Louisville Latin. Winners have fun, losers are done. DJ, hit me!</p><p className="stage">Kiki, Barbie, and Trip do their dance.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Muffy)</span> That was really good.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p><span className="parenthetical">(to Muffy)</span> Yeah, I don’t know if we can compete with that.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(to Bunny and Skip)</span>  Come on, you guys. It was good, but no better than the dancers we beat at our illegal weekend dance-offs. We got this. DJ, play my jam!</p><p className="stage">Muffy, Bunny, and Skip start dancing. They are almost finished when the DJ plays a new song.</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> Oh my goodness, I love this song!</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> Oh no, I feel my feet moving.</p><p className="character">Trip</p>
<p> I can’t stand still when this song is on.</p><p className="stage">Kiki, Barbie, and Trip join in the dancing. Everyone is laughing and when the song ends, they are no longer competing.</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> That was really fun.</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> Yeah, I guess you guys aren’t all bad.</p><p className="character">Skip</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(looks at his watch)</span> Oh my gosh, we’ve been dancing for four hours straight!</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> What now?</p><p className="character">Kiki</p>
<p> Is there somewhere else we can go?</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> How about my house? I have a special dance floor in my backyard that’s surrounded by a garden.</p><p className="character">Trip</p>
<p> I guess that’d be okay.</p><p className="character">Bunny</p>
<p> Sounds good to me.</p><p className="character">Barbie</p>
<p> Let’s go!</p><p className="character">Muffy</p>
<p> Follow me guys. Our party bus awaits!</p><p className="stage">Blackout. End of play.</p>
