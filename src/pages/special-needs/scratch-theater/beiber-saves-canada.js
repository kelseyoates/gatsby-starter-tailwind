<p className="info">This play was written for a student who loves Justin Beiber.</p>
<p className="stage">Justin Beiber finishes singing.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> That’s it for tonight, y’all! Thanks for coming! Peace!</p>
<p className="stage">Justin scurries off the Stage. His mentor greets him.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> Yo yo yo, man. How was the concert?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> It was alright. Not as much screaming as there usually is. And there was a problem in the middle of the show- there was a group of moms who ran onto the Stage and tried to kidnap me. But other than that, it was a good show.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> That’s so weird.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> I know. Usually it’s the daughters who try to take me, although I have gotten some grandmas trying to steal me before.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> That’s crazy, yo.</p>
<p className="stage">A large boom.</p>
<p className="character">Usher (CONT’D) </p>
<p> What was that?</p>
<p className="stage">They look outside the window.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> I don’t know. Did something blow up?</p>
<p className="stage">The phone rings. Usher picks it up.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> Hello?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> This is Prime Minister Harper. May I please speak to Mr. Justin Bieber?</p>
<p className="stage">Usher hands the phone over to Justin.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Whazzup, yo?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Mr. Beiber, this is Stephen Harper.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Who?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Stephen Harper. Your prime minister.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> My what?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> The leader of Canada.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Obama?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Canada, Mr. Bieber.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh, hey, Mr. Canada.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> No, I- whatever. Yes, it is I, Mr. Canada.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh cool. Whazzup, yo?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Mr. Bieber- our nation is in grave danger.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh no, dude. That’s such a mega bummer.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Yes, it is. Anywho, we are being attacked, or rather threatened with an attack. Apparently, when you went to Germany, The Netherlands, and a few other countries, you were a bit- unCanadian. Which is to say, annoying and rude.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> But Mr. Canada man, I’m just being me. I’m Justin Bieber and I gotta do what I gotta do. I don’t know how to do anything other than do me. And If I’m so bad, why are moms, grandmas, and their daughters all trying to kidnap me all the time? For reals, Mr. Canada, I just gotta be me. All I can be, is me, so I just gotta be me, yo.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Yes, well I understand your need to...be you. But we are now being threatened by...all of Europe. Australia may join in, but we haven’t heard back from them yet. They would be on Europe’s side, though.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Dude, is this for real?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Yes, Mr. Bieber. This is indeed for real.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Whoa.</p>
<p className="stage">Justin hangs up and goes back to his Gameboy.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Yo, Ush, can we order some pizza? I’m starving.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> Justin! Did you just hang up on the Canadian prime minister?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Dude, relax, it was just some guy named Mr. Canada.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> Well, what did he want?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> He was just all about the negative, and all this really bad stuff.</p>
<p className="stage">A big boom.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> Did it have anything to do with the big booms we keep hearing?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> I don’t know.</p>
<p className="stage">Usher smacks the Gameboy out of Justin’s hands.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> Listen, little man. The prime minister of your country is counting on you to save your own nation. Don’t you care about Canada?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Meh. My biggest tour money comes from the US.</p>
<p className="character">Usher</p>
<p> There’s not going to be any tour if they destroy this good land! Now get off your boney butt and call him back now!</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> All right, mom. Jeez.</p>
<p className="stage">He returns the call</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Prime Minister Harper speaking.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Yo, I’m ready.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Justin?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Okay. Here’s the plan. Everyone hates you, right?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Haters gonna hate, yo.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Exactly. But there are also legions of young women who love you.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> True that.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> So obviously, you must be doing something right.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Get to the point, dude.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> We need you to sing at them, but only with your catchiest pop tunes.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> You want me to sing for people who hate me?</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Yes. Despite what’s going on in a person’s life, your songs are super catchy and can render a listener powerless. One chorus of baby baby baby oh!, or a very slick production of what sounds like a Justin Timberlake song, and they are putty in the palms of your hands. Now what do you say?</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Yo yo yo yo yo let’s go!</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Wonderful! I’ll meet you outside in a jiff!</p>
<p>Justin runs outside, where the Prime Minister meets him.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Dude, who are all those people?</p>
<p className="stage">They look out- there are armies from every European country ready to blow up Canada.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> All right, Mr. Bieber. This is your chance to save our land. Go!</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> All right, ladies and gentlemen. I get that you’re angry. I get that you’re dressed for war. And I get that you don’t like me. But for just a moment, forget about all that...and just listen to the beat.</p>
<p className="stage">A Bieber song starts to play and the Biebs starts to dance.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> It’s working, it’s working! Look at them all!</p>
<p className="stage">The soldiers are starting to move to the beat. Resistance is futile. Chancellor Angela Merkel moves to the front.</p>
<p className="character">Merkel</p>
<p> Fine fine fine fine fine! We give up! You may live, Herr Bieber. And Canada as well. Those darn bass notes, so very catchy!</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Thanks, lady. Are you somebody’s mom?</p>
<p className="character">Merkel</p>
<p> Let’s leave now before we want to ruin him again.</p>
<p className="stage">The armies exit.</p>
<p className="character">Harper</p>
<p> Well done, Mr. Beiber. You have saved your country and yourself. I couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Thanks, dude. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a Gameboy to play!</p>
<p className="stage">Blackout. End of play.</p>
