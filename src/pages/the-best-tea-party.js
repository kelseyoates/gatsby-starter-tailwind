<p className="stage">There is a 1930s Victorian mansion that has been a bed and breakfast for many years. Weary travelers stop by for its renowned Tea Parties and world-class tea, clotted cream, and scones. Rumor has it that the old mansion is haunted and that sometimes, Tea Partiers’ wishes come true.</p>
<p className="character">Caretaker</p>
<p> Wow, these scones look delicious, the clotted cream simply divine, and the tea an especially magnificent brew today. I sure hope some weary travelers stop by and enjoy this scrumptious eating experience.</p>
<p className="stage">Mildred Cunkle, a cranky old woman, enters.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Not very nice in here, very old, I don’t see what I’m doing here, but I am in need of a resting spot and a cuppa, I guess it’ll do.</p>
<p className="character">Caretaker</p>
<p> Hello, ma’am. Welcome to the Thorverton Arms. How may I help you today?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Is this your establishment? It could use a new coat of paint and some better rugs. That library you have over there also looks very unsatisfactory.</p>
<p className="character">Caretaker</p>
<p> Forgive me, this bed and breakfast is quite old, but I assure you, quite good.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> I’m looking for a place to stay and some refreshments. I was visiting my ungrateful daughter and her brood and I just had to get out of there.</p>
<p className="character">Caretaker</p>
<p> I understand. Have a seat and I’ll be right with you.</p>
<p className="stage">The Caretaker leaves. There is a knock at the door. Mildred looks perplexed. Another knock, and Mildred turns annoyed.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Madam! Madam! Someone is at the door! Psh, old women, so useless.</p>
<p className="stage">Mildred gets out of her chair and crankily walks to the door. She opens it and in bursts a singing Victoria and her dancing back-up dancer, Delores.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle (CONT’D)</p>
<p>  Gah, singing! Why do you insist upon assaulting my ears?</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> I’m Victoria!</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> And I’m Dancing Delores, Victoria’s back-up dancer!</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Hmph. What brings you to this bed and breakfast?</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> The tea party!</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Yes, we have heard great things. We are on a very successful concert tour. But we need a break, so we’re here for the tea party.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> I suppose I could stand to have a few strangers at my table. Where did that batty old lady run off to? I’m ready for my tea.</p>
<p className="stage">Suddenly, Snow White runs into the room.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Hey, it’s Snow White. What are you doing here?</p>
<p className="character">Snow White</p>
<p> It’s raining out.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> You can join our tea party.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Goodness, do they just let anybody in here? Caretaker, I’m ready for my tea! The service here is so terrible, you’d think we were dining at the local Friendly’s.</p>
<p className="character">Snow White</p>
<p> I’m hungry.</p>
<p className="stage">The Caretaker enters with a tray full of tea, scones, and clotted cream.</p>
<p className="character">Caretaker</p>
<p> Here we are, a traditional English afternoon tea.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Finally! I’m practically wasting away over here.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> That looks good.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Are those blueberry scones?</p>
<p className="character">Caretaker</p>
<p> Yes, and we also have chocolate and apricot and strawberry scones as well. They’re so good, some have said they’re almost magical.</p>
<p className="stage">The Caretaker leaves in a suspicious fashion.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Well, magic or not, I’m ready to dig in.</p>
<p className="stage">They all pick their scones and drink their tea.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> Delicious!</p>
<p className="character">Snow White</p>
<p> The tea is very good. (Snow White notices that Delores looks sad.) Why are you sad?</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Don’t tell Victoria, but I really want to go solo. I am ready to take the world by storm.</p>
<p className="character">Snow White</p>
<p> I am sad too. I really want a tan.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> You are very pale. Is that why you were outside?</p>
<p className="character">Snow White</p>
<p> Yes. I wanted to be in the sun.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Maybe you could be my tour manager. We can perform on a cruise. You can get a tan. But how do I tell Victoria?</p>
<p className="stage">Victoria is singing to herself. Mildred is, as usual, annoyed.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Would you please keep it down to a dull roar? I am trying to enjoy my tea.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> But I want to sing!</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> And I want to sit in silence.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> Why are you so cranky?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> How dare you. I am perfectly lovely.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> You’re cranky. Are you sad?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> I am not sad. Or at least, I try not to be.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> I admit that long ago, I had something that made me very happy. But it is gone now, and there is nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> What was it?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> My husband, Thomas William Vanderbilt the third. We were very happy, but one day the army called him up and shipped him overseas. I myself had to move because my father got a new job and without Facebook, I was unable to ever find him again. I don’t know why I’m telling you this, perhaps there is something in this tea that has made me unusually chatty. Is there anything you want that you feel you can’t have?</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> I want to act.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> But you’ve got that Delores as a back-up dancer, and I suppose you don’t want to leave her without a job.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> You an actress, me to once again see my Thomas William Vanderbilt the third, so many things in life we just cannot have.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Excuse me. Did you say Thomas William Vanderbilt the third?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Indeed I did. What say you?</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> He is my uncle! He lives on a farm with pigs and horses and sheep.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> We always wanted a farm! Where is he?</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Wait- is your name Mildred Cunkle?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> What? Yes. How could you have possibly known that?</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> He has told me how much he misses you. He did not know how to find you, though. I can bring you to him.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Oh, Delores, how you have turned my life around. How can I ever thank you?</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> I don’t think there’s anything you can do to make me happy. Unless you own a cruise ship.</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> But that is the job our family moved for. My father founded Cunkle Cruise Lines. We are always looking for new entertainers, if you would like to join us.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> Yay! But wait, I could never leave Victorious.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> I want to act.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> That’s perfect. I can dance on the cruise. But Snow White has to come with me now. She’s my manager.</p>
<p className="character">Snow White</p>
<p> Yes, I need to be on that ship and get my cut. I mean support my client. Did someone say something about scones?</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Why of course. You can help out and enjoy the free vacations and Victoria can pursue an acting career.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> Yay!</p>
<p className="character">Mildred Cunkle</p>
<p> Who would have thought, all of our dreams coming true all because of a Tea Party.</p>
<p className="character">Victoria</p>
<p> This was the best tea party ever.</p>
<p className="character">Delores</p>
<p> More tea, please!</p>
<p className="stage">Blackout. End of play.</p>
