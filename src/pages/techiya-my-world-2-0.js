<p className="stage">Techiya sits on an empty stage. She is doing a sound check.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> <span className="parenthetical">(singing)</span> I’m doing a sound check, list’ning to the sound, making sure my words and music go ‘round and around. <span className="parenthetical">(talking again)</span> How’s it sound, Jenny?</p><p className="character">Jenny</p>
<p> It’s all good back here. This concert is going to be amazing. You know you sold out in under a minute, right?</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> I know, I broke the records, again.</p><p className="character">Jenny</p>
<p> And your album, Fifteen, just went quadruple platinum.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> I know, it’s been a wonderful year for me. My mother is very happy that I gave her my Grammys. She has my Album of the Year trophy on the kitchen table so everyone who enters can see it right away.</p><p className="stage">Techiya’s Manager enters.</p><p className="character">Manager</p>
<p> Hey, girl. Barbara Walters called. She wants to make you one of her ten most fascinating people this year.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Oh I like Barbara Walters. I don’t want to cry, though.</p><p className="character">Manager</p>
<p> Can’t guarantee anything when it comes to Babs, but it should just be a light-hearted thing. Good publicity.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> When will I have the time? I’m in the middle of sold-out, international tour.</p><p className="character">Manager</p>
<p> She’s going to come by tomorrow and we’ll film it in the hotel.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> All right.</p><p className="stage">Techiya’s Publicist enters.</p><p className="character">Publicisit</p>
<p> Whaddup, T?</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Just getting ready for my concert. I really want to go back to my room to rest before I have to sing and dance for three hours straight.</p><p className="character">Publicisit</p>
<p> Of course, of course, but I have a few requests. There’s a JB here to see you.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> JB?</p><p className="stage">JUSTIN BIEBER enters.</p><p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh my goodness, it’s really her!</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> What’s Justin Beiber doing here?</p><p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh, Techiya, I’ve been traveling the world looking for you.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Oh, Justin, haven’t we talked about this already? I’m far too busy to get married.</p><p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh come on, Techiya. We’d make such a great team! I already promised to do all the cooking and cleaning, whatever it takes to keep you on the stage and in happiness.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Really now, Justin. While I appreciate your admiration and affection, I just cannot marry you right now.</p><p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Oh come on, girl.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> No, Justin. I need to focus on my career right now.</p><p className="character">Justin Beiber</p>
<p> Fine, but I’ll be back. I’ll keep coming back until I’ve firmly won your heart.</p><p className="stage">Justin Beiber leaves.</p><p className="character">Manager</p>
<p> Wow, Techiya. I can’t believe you’ve turned him down twice now.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> I love Justin Beiber, but we’re both such mega-superstars we wouldn’t have any time for each other. What’s the point of being married if we’re never going to be in the same place at the same time?</p><p className="character">Manager</p>
<p> I dunno, ask Katy Perry and Russell Brand.</p><p className="character">Publicisit</p>
<p> Techiya, there’s someone else to see you.</p><p className="stage">Logan from Big Time Rush rushes in.</p><p className="character">Logan</p>
<p> Don’t marry him, Techiya! You’d be making the biggest mistake of your life!</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Goodness, Logan. Have some dignity. No, I did not marry Justin Beiber.</p><p className="character">Logan</p>
<p> Thank goodness. Because I think you should marry me.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Logan!</p><p className="character">Logan</p>
<p> Yes, it is I, Logan from Big Time Rush, who is your one true love. Marry me and we’ll go away together.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Logan, you know how dedicated I am to my music. I can’t just leave it all behind.</p><p className="character">Logan</p>
<p> Not even to be with me?</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> If you don’t respect how important music is to me, then you will never be able to truly love me.</p><p className="character">Logan</p>
<p> Surely you’re joking. We’d be perfect together!</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Obviously not. And don’t call me Shirley. Goodbye, Logan.</p><p className="stage">Logan sulks off.</p><p className="character">Manager</p>
<p> Wow, Techiya. You’re made of much stronger stuff than any of us.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Music is who I am. You marry me, you marry the music. At least the Beibs sort of got that <span className="parenthetical">(Techiya sniffs the air.)</span>  Could this really be happening? Could I really be smelling my mother’s homemade spaghetti and meatballs? It couldn’t possibly be true, she’s back in Sharon and I’m here in New York City at Madison Square Garden.</p><p className="stage">Zac Efron walks in, holding a cassarole dish.</p><p className="character">Zac Efron</p>
<p> Hello, Techiya.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Zac Efron? What are you doing with my mother’s spaghetti and meatballs?</p><p className="character">Zac Efron</p>
<p> I knew you had a big concert today and thought, since you’re so far away from your family right now, that I could bring them to you. I drove all the way to Sharon to get this dish and I  brought it right back here to you.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> What do you want from me?</p><p className="character">Zac Efron</p>
<p> Nothing. I want only to make you happy, and I thought this would help. I’ll leave if you want.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> No, you can stay.</p><p className="character">Zac Efron</p>
<p> Thanks. I love watching you perform.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Hey, Zac. How would you like to sing a duet?</p><p className="character">Zac Efron</p>
<p> I’d love that.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Hey, I have an idea. How about you join my tour? We can sing duets and you can sing your own songs as well.</p><p className="character">Zac Efron</p>
<p> That’d be fantastic! Then we could be together all the time. Just you, me, and the music.</p><p className="character">Techiya</p>
<p> Yes, you, me, and the music. </p><p className="stage">Techiya and Zac turn towards the audience and sing their song. Blackout. End of play.</p>
