<p className="info">This play was written for a student who played soccer, practiced karate, and in her own work loved dangerous situations.</p><br />
<p className="stage">A soccer field. The Norwood Sharks are facing the Newton Tigers.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> Ugh, it’s the Sharks.</p><p className="character">Tiger #3</p>
<p> And that girl Faye. She’s their best striker, with the record for most goals scored in a single season.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> I’m so sick of Faye Parker being so good at everything. She must be stopped.</p><p className="character">Tiger #3</p>
<p> But how? I agree, Faye Parker must be destroyed, but, dude, she’s just too good.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> Mark my words. By the end of this game, Faye Parker will be gone from this league and we will, once and for all, be number one.</p><p className="character">Coach Parker</p>
<p> is giving her team a pep talk.</p><p className="character">Coach Parker</p>
<p> Now remember, kids, the Newton Tigers are the number two team in the league, but that’s not going to stop us from crushing them.</p><p className="character">Tori</p>
<p> Don’t worry, I’ll stop any goals from going in our net.</p><p className="character">Katie</p>
<p> And I’ll make sure to get the ball from defense to offense. I am the top midfielder, after all.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> And don’t worry, guys. No one’s gonna take the ball away from me. They’ll have to pry it from my cold, dead feet.</p><p className="character">Katie</p>
<p> What?</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> My point is that I’m very good and I will defeat them.</p><p className="character">Everyone</p>
<p> Gooooooooo Sharks!</p><p className="stage">A whistle blows and everyone runs onto the field for the start of the game.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> I hope you’re ready to lose, Faye P.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> Oh please. Trash talking is such a sad sign of weakness.</p><p className="stage">The whistle blows, they begin.</p><p className="character">Katie</p>
<p> I got it!</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> I’m open!</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> Get her get her get her!</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> shoves Faye to stop her from scoring a goal. Bang! Evil Evan approaches with black nunchuks.</p><p className="character">Evil Evan</p>
<p> Everybody stop!</p><p className="stage">Everyone stops. Evil Evan approaches with nunchuks a-blazing.</p><p className="character">Evil Evan</p>
<p> Where’s Timmy Thompson?</p><p className="stage">Tiger #17 raises his hand meekly.</p><p className="character">Evil Evan</p>
<p> You- your dad owes me money.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p>  Okay it’s yours-</p><p className="character">Evil Evan</p>
<p> He said if I couldn’t have my money, then I could have you. That’s right. He put you up for collateral. Now he’s gonna have to pay me if he wants you back.</p><p className="stage">Katie whispers to Faye.</p><p className="character">Katie</p>
<p> We have to do something.</p><p className="character">Tori</p>
<p> That kid just punched you in the face, we don’t have to do anything!</p><p className="character">Katie</p>
<p> Well we can’t just stand here and let him kidnap that kid.</p><p className="character">Tori</p>
<p> Of course we can. I don’t wanna get in trouble. I got homework and a birthday party next week, I’m not about to let myself get kidnapped.</p><p className="character">Evil Evan</p>
<p> Hey, who’s talking?!</p><p className="stage">Silence.</p><p className="character">Evil Evan (CONT’D)</p>
<p> All right, kid, you’re coming with me.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> Hiiiiiiiiiiyaaaaa!!!!!!!!!</p><p className="stage">Faye attacks Evil Evan and they fight. Nunchuks fly around.</p><p className="character">Coach Parker</p>
<p> Faye, noooooooo!!!!!</p><p className="stage">Faye rolls over. She is covered in blood.</p><p className="character">Tori</p>
<p> Oh my god they got you!</p><p className="character">Katie</p>
<p> Faye, no!</p><p className="stage">They run to her when Faye slowly gets up.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> It’s not my blood, you guys.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> You saved my life! You disarmed the bad guy and saved my life! Even though I just punched you in the face.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> I may not like you, but that’s no reason to let you get kidnapped and held for ransom.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> Thanks, Faye. And I’m sorry I hit you. Like I said before- you’re just so good at everything. And that includes saving my life.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> All in a day’s work. Oh hey, the police-</p><p className="stage">The Police Officer apprehends the suspect and cuffs him.</p><p className="character">Police Officer</p>
<p> Thanks, Faye. Yet another madman off the streets thanks to you.</p><p className="character">Faye</p>
<p> No problem, boys. Just be a little quicker next time, yeah?</p><p className="character">Police Officer</p>
<p> Of course.</p><p className="character">Coach Parker</p>
<p> All right, guys, are you ready to finish this football match? I mean soccer game?</p><p className="character">Everyone</p>
<p> Yeah.</p><p className="stage">A whistle blows and Faye takes the ball upfield, scoring easily.</p><p className="character">Tiger #17</p>
<p> Good goal, Faye.</p><p className="stage">They shake hands and continue the game.  Blackout. End of play.</p>
