<p className="Stage">GHOSTIE LOASTIE is pacing frantically.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>

<p> When is this new DJ going to arrive? We’ve been waiting for hours to start this party. I can’t believe he’d be so unprofessional and would be so late. It’s his first day and we are paying him handsomely. Five dollars an hour, plus we’ll haunt whoever he wants. He can scare his enemies without even trying. Who would turn that kind of deal down? I don’t understand why he’s not-</p>
<p className="Stage">Bang!</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie (continued)</p>
<p> What was that?</p>
<p className="Stage">Bang bang bang!</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie (continued)</p>
<p> What in the underworld?</p>
<p className="Stage">A voice calls out.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> It’s Howard James! I’m here for the party. Let me in.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Howard James, Howard James, hmm, I don’t think you’re on the list. How did you find out about this party?</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> I saw a poster. It looked fun.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Hmm, well it’s gonna cost you if you want to come to my nightclub.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> How much?</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Five million dollars.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> I don’t have that much money.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Do you have anything else with you?</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> I have pizza.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> What kind of pizza?</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> I have ten boxes. Cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, pineapple, hamburger, onion, cheese-free, olive, and everything.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Hmm. Okay, you can come in.</p>
<p className="Stage">Ghostie Loastie opens the door and lets in HOWARD JAMES. Ghostie Loastie immediately takes the pizzas and puts them on the table.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> Wow, this place is cool.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Welcome to my nightclub, the Z Party.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> Gee, you’re really pale.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> I don’t get much sun, where I’m from. Hey, a rhyme.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> It’s weird, having a nightclub under a graveyard.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Is it? All my friends are so close by that it seems like a perfectly supernatural spot.</p>
<p className="Stage">Bang bang bang!</p>
<p className="character">Z-master</p>
<p> It’s Z-Master! The DJ!</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Finally, I can’t believe you’re so late!</p>
<p className="Stage">Ghostie Loastie opens the door for him, helping the DJ to set up his equipment.</p>
<p className="character">Z-master</p>
<p> Cool place.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Thank you. Z-Master, this is Howard James.</p>
<p className="character">Z-master</p>
<p> Hello.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> Hello.</p>
<p className="character">Z-master</p>
<p> Pizza!</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> Yes, there are ten kinds.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Too bad one of them wasn’t brains.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> What? Nothing...so, Z-Master, I’m very excited you’ve arrived. Tonight is a very special night here at the Z-Party.</p>
<p className="character">Z-master</p>
<p> What do you mean?</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Well, my friends and I have been getting bored of the usual people. We thought we could use some fresh meat.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> I understand. Sometimes the boredom eats at me too.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> Funny you should mention eating. Not funny haha, but funny in that I’m going to eat your brains.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p className="character">Z-master</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> My friends and I have been hungering for something new, something exciting, something...delicious.</p>
<p className="character">Howard james</p>
<p> Oh no, they’re zombies! Run, Z-Master, run!</p>
<p className="Stage">Ghostie Loastie chases Howard JAMES and Z-MASTER around the club. Howard James and Z-Master escape, leaving Ghostie Loastie huffing and puffing. He yells out.</p>
<p className="character">Ghostie loastie</p>
<p> You two are lucky I died of smoke inhalation! Sorry, everyone, no new brains tonight. But hey, we’ve still got the pizza. I call the everything!</p>
<p className="Stage">Blackout. End of play. </p>
